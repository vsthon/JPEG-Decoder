# JPEG-Decoder
A JPEG Decoder I wrote for learning purposes.

Where I learned about the JPEG File structure:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4FSkFUgs&list=PLpsTn9TA_Q8VMDyOPrDKmSJYt1DLgDZU4
* https://www.impulseadventure.com/photo/jpeg-huffman-coding.html
* https://alexdowad.github.io/visualizing-the-idct/
* https://unix4lyfe.org/dct/

This is very unoptomized and only supports non-subsampled, huffman coded baseline JPEGs so you probably shouldn't use this.
